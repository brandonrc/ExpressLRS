# PP 2.4 GHz Rx

https://easyeda.com/jyesmith/ccg-pico-ceramic_copy

This rx is a remix of the RX_CCG_Nano, so credit to @juhtipuhti for the initial design.

The PP is a 10 x 10mm rx with a chip antenna and weighs in at 0.42g!

The base of the PCB can be assembled by JLC, leaving you only 5 components on the top to place.  It is recommended to also order a stencil for solder paste.  A hot air station is required.
